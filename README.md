# MentaBench - Mental Health AI Model Evaluation on iOS

MentaBench is an iOS benchmarking application for evaluating mental health classification models on mobile devices. The project benchmarks **Menta**, our custom-trained mental health model based on Qwen3-4B (fine-tuned via LoRA), against baseline models including Microsoft's Phi-4-mini (3.8B) and Alibaba's Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507. The benchmark evaluates model performance across 6 mental health classification tasks: stress detection, depression detection and severity classification, suicide ideation detection, suicide risk assessment, and multi-level risk severity classification. All inference runs entirely on-device using llama.cpp with Metal GPU acceleration, providing comprehensive metrics including accuracy, latency (TTFT), throughput (ITPS/OTPS), memory usage, and CPU utilization. This platform enables direct comparison between specialized fine-tuned models and general-purpose language models for mental health applications.
